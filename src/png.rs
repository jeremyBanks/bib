// How about you do this *after* you get the rest working?

// pkPK "comment" wrappers for every zip chunk?
// put a png IEND chunk in the zip file's trailing comment?

// You could indeed include the PNG in the zip archive itself, by
// a second PNG header in the comment of the first PNG header.

find a pen and DRAW THIS!!
